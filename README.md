This repo supports a pilot project for using **Inkplate 2** e-paper displays and **Arduino programming** in a middle school Gifted & Talented setting. The goal: teach real coding with visual hardware, build persistence, and make tech education rigorous *and* hands-on.

## What's Inside

| Folder        | What's in it                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `docs/`       | Proposal slides, NAGC standards alignment table   |
| `sketches/`   | Working Arduino code used in class                |
| `assets/`     | Supporting files (icons, bitmap headers, etc.)    |

## Pilot Goals

- Build independence and grit through real device coding  
- Teach hardware + software in a clean, visual format  
- Center problem-solving and debugging as core thinking skills  
- Support cross-curricular projects (data science, art, ecology, etc.)

## Audience

This was designed for **Gifted & Talented students in grades 6–8** at Carver Middle School (Tulsa Public Schools). Aligned to **NAGC 2019 standards**.

## Status

Pilot is in active development. First phase includes:
- 1 classroom Inkplate 10 (for shared display)
- 4 student Inkplate 2 kits (with Raspberry Pis)
- Curriculum modules in progress
